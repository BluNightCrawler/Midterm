We have taken the UX details from our second project to add functions
Which include Create, Delete, REad, Update. Which we call CRUD
So we take a data we have the user put into the website and show it with all these different functions
we then use Delete just like it says to remove the object
We use Create for the user to creat a thing which I chose people full name and a little about them
TGhen we can read the list and update the inputs if there was an error or if there is a update of the informaitpn
We can read the data by looking at the data on the read page.
Then a delete when you look at the page to read all the inputs and go to update and you can delete it and take it away.
Final Project
I have taken this assignment and turned it into my final because it was already up and running knew it worked. 
Plus for me to make the code look better since I was going to reference this project to start from scratch why not just be profiencent and make a project better then it was.
This was a big step for me learning and the hardest part was to connect the API if I can connect it. I do not fully understand VM to send it into a API.
One thing I feel like is more of the promblem is understanding python and how to connect it because the view is where it getting diffcult for me. There seems to have no way to change the view it just grabbing information
But the main things I changes was the presentation so it is easier to access all the different pages for Post, Update, Get, and Delete CRUD
Main Changes: Text to read what happening. Layout better, and overall shows what I have improved on and know how to build a project.
Main things I learned in this class was CRUD, how to actually build a project in Android studio where I can even put API into the project. I put a map on android studio that works to see the area you want. Maybe not directions but maybe that could be the next step.
Thanks for the class and looking forward to learing more in the future when I have two more quarters left.
This whole project Has an inside API which contains only to the user I could not seem to make the API public or too even give access to to others.
This project was easy to get the rest up to date with all the other functions and to work smoothly with each other.

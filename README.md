We have taken the UX details from our second project to add functions
Which include Create, Delete, REad, Update. Which we call CRUD
So we take a data we have the user put into the website and show it with all these different functions
we then use Delete just like it says to remove the object
We use Create for the user to creat a thing which I chose people full name and a little about them
TGhen we can read the list and update the inputs if there was an error or if there is a update of the informaitpn
We can read the data by looking at the data on the read page.
Then a delete when you look at the page to read all the inputs and go to update and you can delete it and take it away.
